# Insper Projects

A shared space for collaborative academic projects developed by students from Insper's Computer Science program.

This organization was created to host group assignments and technical projects in a way that promotes shared ownership, transparency, and continuity. Instead of relying on **individual GitHub accounts** to manage repositories, teams can now collaborate within a common environment where all members have access and the ownership is distributed (*repository-based*).

## 🎯 Goals

- Avoid associating academic repositories with individual student accounts.
- Facilitate team collaboration and project continuity.
- Enable fair and transparent project contributions.
- Centralize Insper Computer Science group projects for better organization and reuse.
- Promote real-world engineering practices in an academic setting.

## 📌 Scope

This organization is **exclusive** to students who began their Computer Science undergraduate studies at **Insper in 2025.1**.  
Repository names are globally unique on GitHub, so this constraint ensures consistent naming without collisions across future cohorts.

## 🧪 Methodology

Most group projects here will follow **Agile methodologies**, especially **Scrum**, with public visibility enabled by default to encourage open collaboration and feedback.

Each repository should ideally include:

- A **Scrum board** under the “Projects” tab, with Sprints, Backlog, and Tasks.
- A defined **team** with clear roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developers).
- A structured **branching model** (e.g., `main`, `dev`, feature branches).
- Semantic and well-documented **commits**, following this guide:

## 🛠 How to use

> Assuming you have permission to...

1. **Create a team** under the organization for your class or project group.
2. **Create a repository** using a clear, short, lowercase, dash-separated name.
3. **Add team members** as collaborators to the repo or through the team.
4. **Initialize your Scrum board** in the Projects tab.
5. **Push your code**, track issues, and follow structured Git collaboration.

## 🧩 Repository Naming Convention

Use lowercase names with dashes. Avoid initials or obscure abbreviations.

Example:

| Project Name       | Repository Name     |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Projeto Pygame     | `pygame-project`    |
| Analisador Léxico  | `lexical-analyzer`  |
| Simulador RISC-V   | `riscv-simulator`   |

> 💡 Avoid using course codes or semester-specific terms in the repo name to keep things clean and reusable.
